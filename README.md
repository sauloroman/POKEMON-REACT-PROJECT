<img src="./assets/design/Pokemon-coverpage.png" width="700" alt="PokemonApp coverpage" />

This responsive web application performs consumption to different endpoints of a well-known API, with which multiple characters of the Pokemon series are deployed.

It has the possibility of filtering the characters by means of certain criteria that the user can choose, as well as making searches through the name of some of these same.

In addition, it has integrated an alert system that prevents unexpected entries, dynamic paging, loading screen, and a path in which the user can make configurations such as the theme and the number of characters per page.

It is worth mentioning that this project uses different routes to control navigation within the application and implements protected routes.
