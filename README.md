<h1>PokemonApp</h1>

<p>This responsive web application performs consumption to different endpoints of a well-known API, with which multiple characters of the Pokemon series are deployed.</p>

<p>It has the possibility of filtering the characters by means of certain criteria that the user can choose, as well as making searches through the name of some of these same.</p>

<p>
In addition, it has integrated an alert system that prevents unexpected entries, dynamic paging, loading screen, and a path in which the user can make configurations such as the theme and the number of characters per page. </p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that this project uses different routes to control navigation within the application and implements protected routes.</p>
